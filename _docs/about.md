## Hi!
I am a graduate student at `Computational Clinical Science Laboratory` (PI: Woo-young Ahn). I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Public Governance & Leadership from Korea University (Feb 2020).

## Research Interest
I am mainly interested in ***clinical psychology*** and ***decision neuroscience***. Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using ***neurocomputational*** and ***machine learning*** approaches. I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology.

## Research Experience
### Research Assistant (May, 2018 ~ Aug, 2019):
I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at `Laboratory of Social Decision Neuroscience` (PI: Hackjin Kim). I designed and led a fMRI project aiming to reveal neural mechanism of prosocial behavior under stress.  

### University of Hong Kong (Exchange student, Jan, 2018 ~ May, 2018):
