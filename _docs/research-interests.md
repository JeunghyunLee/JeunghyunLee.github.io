I am mainly interested in **clinical psychology** and **decision neuroscience**. Particularly, I seek to understand the roles of stress in decision making and how they are implicated in certain psychiatric conditions using **neurocomputational** and **machine learning** approaches. I aim to become a scientist who builds tools that help people make better decisions in the realm of psychiatric issues. To this end, I am eager to combine computational modeling and neuroscience with clinical psychology.
