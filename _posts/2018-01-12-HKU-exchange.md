I started my life as an exchange student at **University of Hong Kong**. I took courses from the Department of Psychology:
* Biological Psychology
* Fundamentals of social psychology
* Introduction to counselling and therapeutic psychology
* Perception

As an exchange student, I met good friends from various countries and made many precious memories, especially enjoying hiking and backpacking together.
